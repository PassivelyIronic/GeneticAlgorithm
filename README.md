# Genetic Algorithm Optimization

A simple yet flexible Python implementation of a genetic algorithm for solving optimization problems. This project is ideal for experimentation, learning, and visualization of how evolutionary algorithms work over generations.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Customizable genetic algorithm (selection, crossover, mutation)
- Visual tracking of algorithm performance across generations
- Clean and modular code structure
- Easy integration with other optimization problems

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Output

After running the algorithm, youâ€™ll see plots showing:
- Best fitness over time
- Average fitness over time

These visualizations help understand convergence behavior and the effectiveness of genetic operators.
